### Folder organization
Inside folder ```numerical_methods``` there are the ```.tex``` files belonging to the numerical methods lectures, conversely ```optimization``` folder contains the optimization-related files.

The ```pics``` folder contains all the pictures that have been used in the notes.

### Todos
* Fix references across the whole document, which do not work
* Make vector notation uniform: I always write explicitly the space the vector belongs, so no bold notation is needed. But in some places I didn't change it from the cut&paste from the slides

### Labels syntax
`\label{type:date_id}`, where `type` can be "fig", "theo", "prop", etc. date is the date of the lecture in the following format: "10ott" or "28nov"). The id is an identifier of the item, in particular it may express the meaning of theobject or be a numeric identifier.

### Matlab textbox
`\syntax{}` creates a Matlab textbox

### Do you recall? textbox
`\recap{}` creates a reminder textbox

The idea behind this repository is to build something useful to many students through a cooperative system.
Anyone who wants to contribute to this repository is very welcome to do so, reproduction is allowed in any form, but we forbid anyone to sell these notes and manke economical profit out of it.

###Folder organization
Inside folder ```numerical_methods``` there are the ```.tex``` files belonging to the numerical methods lectures, conversely ```optimization``` folder contains the optimization-related files.

The ```picture``` folder contains all the pictures that have been used in the notes.

### Todos
* Fix references across the whole document, which do not work
* Make vector notation uniform: I always write explicitly the space the vector belongs, so no bold notation is needed. But in some places I didn't change it from the cut&paste from the slides

### Labels syntax
`\label{type:date_id}`, where `type` can be "fig", "theo", "prop", etc. date is the date of the lecture in the following format: "10ott" or "28nov"). The id is an identifier of the item, in particular it may express the meaning of theobject or be a numeric identifier.

### Matlab textbox
`\syntax{}` creates a Matlab textbox

### Do you recall? textbox
`\recap{}` creates a reminder textbox
